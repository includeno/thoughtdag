## Philosophy

Chat terminals are harnesses for doing: they optimize for handing you an answer and hide everything else. ThoughtDAG is an instrument for thinking: the unit of value is the reasoning structure itself, kept legible, editable and repeatable.

Mind maps are drawn; this map grows. Chat leaves no map at all.

*The graph is acyclic. You are the loop.*

## Canvas & context: the One Rule family

- **DAG context engine**: `buildContext()` walks all incoming edges, builds history in topological order
- **Layered context assembly**: materials → reference blocks → the conversation, ordering independent of wiring history (same graph, same prompt)
- **Purple edges** (continue): inherit the full ancestor context
- **Orange solid edges** (explore): select text → branch right with the selection as context; solid always means structural, dashed always means bypass (reference / watch)
- **Reference edges (dashed)**: drop a hand-drawn wire on any node to quote it (Q&A + upstream question trail) without dragging its whole conversation in; depth is a first-class edge property: toggle quote ⇄ full on the selected edge OR in the panel's context tree, and the connect toast prices both options (silent when the source has no chain)
- **Context send preview**: live "~N tok · M messages · K files" plus a materials · references · conversation layer breakdown before asking
- **Click-to-delete edges**: select an edge for a floating delete button; right-click menu works too; Cmd+Z undoes
- **Archive (prune-but-keep)**: dimmed on canvas, excluded from every context walk, restorable; batch via multi-select
- **Merge Synthesis**: box-select nodes → structured synthesis (conclusions / evidence / open questions)
- **Highlight system**: three downstream modes: 📄 Full text / 🏷️ Tag important / ✂️ Highlights only; marks render across lists and tables; stale highlights auto-clean on edit; an all-highlights overview (by time / by node) pinpoints each mark's source node, exports Markdown, and weaves any checked subset into one cited passage
- **Node role system**: per-node system prompt with three modes (inherit / set for next / reset here), `appliedRole` recorded at generation time, radio picker for multi-parent conflicts
- **Role library, user-editable**: built-ins plus your own roles; add, edit and remove in a manager (editing a built-in makes your copy; restore anytime); applied roles stay frozen on their nodes
- **Token counting**: per-node usage display

## Reading & materials

<img src="reading-en.gif" alt="Screen recording: selecting a sentence on the original PDF page, asking about it, the answer streaming into the annotation rail while the passage keeps a bubble mark, then a guided digest with page jumps" width="100%"/>

- **Material reader**: original PDF rendering with a selectable text layer (pdf.js); select → ask lands a branch node with `(p.N)` provenance, and the passage keeps an anchor on the page (highlight wash + a bubble that reopens the thread); canvas nodes carry a p.N chip that jumps back into the reader; extracted-text view for scanned PDFs; a footer thread index tagging each conversation p.N or whole-material; per-material scroll memory
- **Annotation rail**: answers stream beside the document; follow-ups chain onto the thread; selecting inside a rail answer explores (branch of THAT answer) or highlights; thread chips switch conversations, a crosshair jumps to the canvas
- **Answers get the reading loop too**: every response opens reading-size; select to highlight or to branch from that passage, ask follow-ups below, and the viewer swaps to the new node so a whole chain of questions streams in place
- **Guided digest**: one click turns the material into a short structured post in the UI language, with (p.N) jump buttons back into the original pages; the digest is a canvas NODE (versioned on rewrite, model-stamped, wireable downstream as the material's compression); regenerating routes through the digest prompt against the full text
- **Recognize (scanned PDFs)**: per-page vision rewrite into Markdown/LaTeX, editable; external OCR output pastes in
- **Content nodes**: notes (markdown), file nodes with PDF covers, time-stamped link snapshots; paste-driven creation; image auto-reading picks the strongest configured vision model; every material opens in the reader
- **Attachment system**: node-local attachments (drag/paste/upload), inherited include/exclude control, fingerprint dedup, automatic Vision switching for images; PDFs feed context as extracted text and wear their first page as a cover on file nodes
- **Material-first landing**: drop a document on the landing page and it lands as a material node with the reader auto-opened; attachments to the root question stay behind the explicit paperclip

## Map & review

<img src="hero-en.png" alt="ThoughtDAG map view: a waterfall DAG of thought, every plaque badged by cognitive move, with the focus panel showing a node's full answer and its token-priced context chain" width="100%"/>

- **Map mode**: three tiers with hysteresis: full cards → takeaway plaques → glyph seals (one icon per node); seals and edges counter-scale to a fixed screen size (map-pin style), so zooming further out tightens the map instead of shrinking it; nodes awaiting human input keep their working form
- **Typed takeaways**: one conclusion-first line per answer version, auto-classified (✕ ruled out · ⚖ decided · ↩ pivoted · ? open; insight stays unmarked); display layer only, never enters context or fingerprints
- **Staleness tracking**: per-generation upstream fingerprints; amber badges on nodes, dots in the context tree, explicit [Stale] marks in downstream payloads
- **Batch replay**: one click re-runs every stale node in dependency order; confirm dialog with a token estimate; stop anytime
- **Version management**: regenerate in place appends a comparable version (page through, delete, revert; downstream staleness reacts to the active version); "Regenerate as branch" spawns a parallel sibling for A/B runs
- **Topology check-up**: on-demand diagnostics with deterministic findings (residual edges, shadow references, blind-pool breaches, pool asymmetry) plus observations (long chains, open branches, collider continuations); locate + one-click fix
- **Canvas search (toolbar icon or Cmd+F)**: exact search across questions, answers, note bodies, highlights, link titles and material names; while you type, matching nodes stay lit and the rest of the map dims (the searchlight); picking a result flies there, opens the panel and scrolls to the exact match
- **Ancestor edge highlighting**: the selected node's path to root turns gold, others dim

## Large-canvas organization

- **Active-node neighborhood**: switch between the full canvas and one- or two-level local projections without changing node positions or context semantics
- **Independent organization relations**: parent, child and directed jump links live outside LLM context, with multi-parent support and parent-cycle validation
- **Project taxonomy**: reusable tags and custom node types support create, rename, delete and batch assignment without replacing the system `stepKind`
- **Combined filters**: text, system/custom type, multiple tags, creation date, relation scope and archive status combine with AND semantics, including filter-only queries
- **Tree / Card views**: expandable organization hierarchy and date-grouped cards share active-node, selection and query state with Canvas
- **Durable recovery**: append-only change/undo/redo transactions, monotonic revisions and persisted cursors keep Undo/Redo available after reload

## Generation & automation

- **Streaming responses**: SSE token-by-token rendering with blinking cursor, in node and panel; Stop keeps partial content; failed generations show Retry (errors go to toasts, never into answers)
- **Reviewer preset**: critic role on a sliding red edge; re-critiques each new step automatically, history versioned; reviewers are ordinary nodes (question them, branch from them)
- **Paradigm mode** (entrances temporarily backstage while the running experience is rebuilt; existing paradigm canvases still open): human/prompt steps + material slots; instantiate → cascade → unlock; edit the input + replay = re-run the experiment; bounded reviewer rounds declared in the file
- **Ambient memory**: a background judge classifies durable facts (preference / identity / project) with admission rules in code, visible toast + undo on every write; project entries decay out of context after 45 days; one global switch (default on), manager with category badges, paste-import and JSON export; machine steps and digests stay memory-free
- **Edit everything**: double-click a question to edit it; answers edit via a pencil button beside regenerate and copy (double-click stays a text-selection gesture); text selection toolbar (Branch / Highlight)

## Models & search

- **Any model**: nine provider families register from `.env` keys; a toolbar picker switches at any time; text-only models reroute automatically when images appear
- **Model interface manager**: no `.env` needed; provider presets pin only the endpoint address, and the model list is fetched live from the endpoint's `/models` route (never goes stale); a local Ollama is detected keylessly; a custom-endpoint field catches every other OpenAI-compatible service; keys stay in localStorage + proxy memory, never on disk; with nothing configured the toolbar wears a Connect-a-model button that opens the manager directly
- **Per-node model override**: any node can pin its own LLM (badge on the card, sibling regenerations inherit it); cheap models for exploration, flagship for the hard steps; every version records which model wrote it
- **Agentic search**: AI SDK tool loop: web search + arXiv + Semantic Scholar (free APIs), `[n]` citations + persisted references, guaranteed synthesis fallback, per-group toolbar toggles
- **MCP tool ecosystem**: `mcp.config.json` (stdio + HTTP/SSE transports); tools join the agentic loop with per-call progress; mock server included for testing
- **Capabilities panel**: search engine choice, scholar status, vision model preference and memory switch in one place, at the model picker's foot

## Desktop app

- **One download, everything bundled**: the same app in its own window with the local engine inside; no Node, no terminal; macOS builds are signed and notarized by Apple
- **Updates wait for your click**: the app checks quietly, announces a new version as an in-app notice, and downloads and restarts only on your say-so; a Check-for-updates menu entry shows the version you are on and answers out loud (found / latest / could not check); download progress lives on the Dock icon
- **Every model gets the full toolset**: on desktop the bundled engine serves keyless web search, scholarly search, MCP tools and the vision reroute to every connected model, including browser-direct-only providers on the web
- **One-click sign-in via your own browser**: OpenRouter authorization opens in the system browser where you are already signed in; the app picks the result up by itself and lands you on the fresh model list

## Workbench & data

- **Infinite canvas**: pan, zoom, drag nodes freely (React Flow)
- **Column-Tree auto-layout**: main chain flows down, branches fork right; real measured heights prevent overlap; Tidy layout / Align selection on demand
- **Frames**: labeled colored regions with a navigator jump list; hide-annotations view toggle
- **Focus panel (floating overlay)**: cards-on-wash reading layout over the canvas (which never resizes), context tree grouped by materials / references / conversation, follow-up input; drag-resizable width
- **Markdown + LaTeX**: full markdown, syntax highlighting, inline and block math
- **Multi-select**: box-select nodes: Merge Summary / Merge & Delete / Align / Export / Delete
- **Read-only share links**: one link carries the whole graph (compressed into the URL, no server storage); the viewer walks, zooms and reads but cannot edit; share from the ⋯ menu
- **@-mentions**: type @ in any ask box to reference a node by name; mentions not already upstream get a real dashed reference edge (visible, priced, convertible), upstream ones become precise designators
- **Automatic folder backup**: grant a folder once and every change debounces the active canvas into a real `.thoughtdag.json` on disk; point it at a synced directory and it doubles as cross-device sync with zero servers; a toolbar control center shows the last write and can back up the active canvas on demand
- **Event log**: an append-only record of semantic operations (asks, generations, highlights, archiving, undo) with timestamps, metadata-only; travels in backups, exports as CSV for R/Python analysis
- **Local CLI control plane**: off by default and authorized by group/command; supports reading, editing, organizing, import/export and history while destructive permissions remain disabled by default
- **Node context menu**: right-click for open panel / reading view / regenerate (in place or as a new node) / copy / duplicate / archive / delete; right-clicking selected text keeps the native menu
- **Data persistence**: IndexedDB auto-save (1s debounce), survives refresh; multi-canvas projects (create/switch/rename/delete)
- **Export system**: whole-graph JSON backup and import; context-chain / multi-select Markdown export; memory and roles export too: easy in, easy out
- **Import ChatGPT / Claude exports**: drop conversations.json into Import; edit/regenerate branches are preserved as graph forks, each conversation becomes its own canvas
- **Undo/Redo**: Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z through entity-level `before/after` compensation transactions persisted with each project
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Space collapse, R regenerate, arrow keys walk the DAG, Esc steps out (legend in the tutorial)
- **Bilingual UI**: auto-detects browser language, one-click EN/中 switch
- **Built-in tutorial**: a ten-step illustrated hero page, from asking to paradigms
- **Example canvas**: one labeled click on the landing page loads four framed chapters around one everyday question: conversation grammar, materials & references, the ⚖️ context-pruning pair, and a reading loop with a real embedded PDF (anchored question, digest node); every node carries a typed takeaway so zooming out lands on a working map; reload anytime from the landing screen

## Roadmap

**Near term**
- [ ] Save any canvas as a paradigm (reverse instantiation)
- [ ] Attachment blob separation (scaling image-heavy canvases)

**Long term**
- [ ] Run comparison view (same paradigm, N runs side by side)
- [ ] Artifact nodes (file deliverables on canvas, Monaco editor + version history)
- [ ] Async collaboration: share a paradigm, collect runs
