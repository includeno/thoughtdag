## The one rule

> **Wires are the context.** What the model sees is exactly what wires into the node. Editing the graph edits the model's memory.

Many tools put conversations on a canvas. In ThoughtDAG, a wire is not decoration or an execution route. It determines what the model sees next.

## In action

One principle behind every gesture: **the human in the loop, the model on the wires**. No autonomous agent redraws your graph.

<td width="55%">

### ✂️ Delete one edge, get a different answer

The model sees only what wires in. Delete the noise edge, ask again, and the same prompt returns a clean answer. **Reproduce it in chapter ③ of the example canvas.**

### 📖 Read a paper into a map

Select a passage, ask right there. The answer lands on the canvas with its page number, and the p.N chip jumps back to the page. **Finish the paper, and the map is drawn.**

<td width="55%">

### 💎 Condense, zoom out, and export the shape

Merge nodes into a higher conclusion; weave highlights into cited prose. Zoom through full cards, takeaway plaques and an icon skeleton. Then export the current structure as a light or dark Thought Map.

### 🧭 Session Atlas: bring agent conversations onto the canvas

Bring work scattered across different agents into one editable context graph. Continue from any node, then bring the new work back to where the thought began.

*Currently supports local Claude Code and Codex sessions, with more agent integrations in development. Source sessions remain read-only.*

## How ThoughtDAG differs

Many products use nodes and edges, but the graph does a different job in each category.

| Product category | How it differs from ThoughtDAG |
|---|---|
| Linear chat | Context follows one chronological thread; ThoughtDAG selects and merges visible paths. |
| Mind maps and whiteboards | Edges organize ideas for people; ThoughtDAG edges also change model input. |
| Branching chat canvases | They usually follow one inherited branch; ThoughtDAG can merge or prune several paths. |
| Workflow and agent canvases | Edges run tasks and data; ThoughtDAG edges control conversational context. |
| RAG and automatic memory | The system retrieves context automatically; ThoughtDAG makes the selection visible and editable. |

ThoughtDAG is a user-authored context graph: incoming paths and explicit references form the next request, while excluded work stays visible on the canvas.

Large canvases can switch to a one- or two-level active neighborhood, Tree or Card view, then use independent organization links, project tags, custom types and combined filters. Those navigation relations never enter model context, and durable transactions keep Undo/Redo available after reload.

## 🗺️ Export the shape of your thinking

The export keeps the nodes, wires and high-level structural counts. Different questions and different ways of exploring them leave visibly different maps.

## Quick start

### Desktop app

On macOS, install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask thoughtdag
```

Or use the [download page](https://chenxiachan.github.io/thoughtdag/#download), which detects your platform and gives you the right installer; [Releases](https://github.com/chenxiachan/thoughtdag/releases/latest) keeps every build. macOS builds are signed and notarized. Windows builds are not signed yet and may show a SmartScreen warning.

### Connect the Codex or Claude Code skill

Session Atlas discovers and opens your local sessions with no setup at all — and an open canvas keeps following its conversation on its own. To jump from a conversation straight to its canvas inside the agent:

- Claude Code: `/thoughtdag`
- Codex: `$thoughtdag`

Enable it in **Session Atlas → Sources**: the app installs one readable local command file, removable anytime.

### Run from source

```bash
npm install
npm run server    # LLM proxy :3001
npm run dev       # → localhost:5173
# No .env? Connect any OpenAI-compatible endpoint inside the app
```

Environment variables, local models and connection details → [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)

### Browser demo

Want a ten-second look before installing anything? The [hosted demo](https://app.thoughtdag.workers.dev) runs in the browser, and the example canvas needs no key. It is a feature subset: Session Atlas, local session discovery, keyless web search, some direct-connection tools and the subscription bridge are desktop/local-only.

## 🧪 Research: Why editable context matters

### Context Intervention Benchmark · Pilot v2

`9 models` · `1,485 test runs` · `$0 in free tiers` · `answers scored by exact match`

Context does not only fade as conversations grow longer. A wrong statement flows into the replies that come after it and undermines the truthfulness of every later conclusion. Our benchmark verified this across nine language models and found the effect to be widespread: deleting the message that introduced the error is often not enough, because the follow-up replies still carry it. Restoring correct answers required cleaning up the affected passage as a whole, or letting the model rewrite it. In one model whose step-by-step thinking we could switch on and off, the minimal cleanup only worked while thinking was on. Managing context, not just accumulating it, decides what a model gets right.

The full report explains the method, the numbers and their statistics, and what this does and does not establish. It does not rank models and does not explain their inner workings; it tests one observable claim: changing what a model sees changes what it answers next.

## More capabilities

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| 📤 Read-only share | One link carries the whole graph: no account, no server storage |
| 🧭 Staleness & replay | Upstream edits mark the answers they invalidate; replay in dependency order, token estimate first |
| ✂️ Clipping | Select a passage or drag a rectangle in the reader; it becomes canvas material with page provenance |
| 🔌 Any model | Per-node pins that follow the line; text-only models read images through their companion text |
| 🧭 Agent session continuity | Bring sessions from different agents into one map; continue from any node and return the result to the graph. |
| 🔒 Local-first | Automatic folder backup writes real files; point it at a synced folder for cross-device |

Full feature list (60+, grouped by area) → [docs/features.md](docs/features.md)

The local CLI can operate projects, nodes, edges, materials, organization and import/export after explicit per-command authorization; destructive permissions are disabled by default. See the [CLI guide](docs/cli_ZH.md).

## Models, cost & privacy

Connect a local Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Built-in presets, subscription connections and environment variables are documented in [setup](docs/setup.md).

- **The free model tier covers every feature**; a local Ollama runs fully offline
- **In the desktop app everything lives on your machine**: canvases, keys, documents; on the web demo, model traffic runs browser-direct and keys never touch the server
- **PDFs never leave your machine**; only extracted text travels when you ask
- **The backup format stays backward compatible**; Markdown export is the permanent escape hatch
